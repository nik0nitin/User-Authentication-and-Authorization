Be specific about JWT Token Subject -> Email/Username (Subject will be whatever you choose)

If our User Entity contains both, email & username, we makes changes to getUsername method if we want to use email or username.

When User Class implements UserDetails always overwrite getPassword(), getUsername() methods. By default they return null.

Hence Bcrypt Password will return empty password error in Database because we use UserDetailsService to retrieve
UserDetails(User) and further user GetPassword(), getUsername() methods to validate.

Login -> username & password == UserDetailsService -> UserDetails(userDetails.getUsername() & userDetails.getPassword)

Debugging Solves problems.
